In this study, a software-based FMCW radar operating in the 2.4 GHz frequency band was implemented using the Adalm-Pluto SDR. This thesis includes a detailed investigation of the work and the design stages. The aim of the FMCW radar is to measure both the position and velocity of moving objects using electromagnetic waves. By measuring the Doppler effect caused by the electromagnetic wave reflecting off a moving object and the time it takes for the wave to reach the receiving antenna, the goal was to determine the speed and distance information. Due to the limited performance and capabilities of the hardware used (USB 2.0 data rate, AD9361 bandwidth, etc.), some constraints were encountered. Although the desired sensitivity could not be achieved because of these limitations, the movements of objects up to approximately 3 meters could be detected. A microstrip antenna previously designed and analyzed with CST Studio Suite was used in the early stages of testing. However, due to performance issues, it was later replaced with a 10 dBi gain Vivaldi antenna.
The radar was tested in real-time using Python. Although slower compared to the C language, Python was preferred because it is easy, practical, and most importantly, compatible with Adalm-Pluto. Chirp signals were generated using ready-made Python libraries and transmitted through Adalm-Pluto. The received signal was processed using a 2D FFT method to extract distance and velocity information. Real-time visualization was done with Python’s graphics libraries.
Due to Adalm-Pluto’s hardware limitations, the distance measurement did not provide the desired results, but velocity information related to human movement was measured with an accuracy of 1.95 m/s. Because of insufficient computer hardware and the low real-time signal processing performance in Python, velocity resolution was kept low. Despite the low radar cross section of humans, measurements were still successfully made.
The study also aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing an FMCW radar at the undergraduate level with cost considerations. By using Adalm-Pluto, this radar design provides an approach that does not require extra high-cost RF components (such as RF mixers, VCOs, etc.), which are rare in similar applications in Turkey, thus contributing to undergraduate education. Although a system constructed with specially produced radar components is expected to be more performant, this study preferred a design method that is easier to implement rather than focusing on precision. Both experimental and theoretical results showed considerable success.
